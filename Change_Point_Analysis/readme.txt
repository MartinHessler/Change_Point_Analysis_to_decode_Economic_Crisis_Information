cp_prob...npy contain the joint probabilities of the corresponding change point configurations.
cp_pdfs...npy contain the marginal probability density functions of the ordinal change point positions averaged over all configurations.
cp_configs...npy contain the configurations.
segment_fit...npy contain the segment fit data.
segment_fit_variance...npy contain corresponding variances.

In the case of five change points the only the plotted 1st, 13th and 26th most probable configuration are stored in config_ranking_CP1_5.npy to
save memory.
